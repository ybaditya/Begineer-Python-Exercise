#This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), 
# except require the solution in a different way.

# Take two lists, say for example these two:

# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
#  Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. 
# Write this in one line of Python using at least one list comprehension. 
# (Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).

# The original formulation of this exercise said to 
# write the solution using one line of Python, 
# but a few readers pointed out that this was impossible to do without using sets 
# that I had not yet discussed on the blog, so you can either choos
# e to use the original directive and read about the set command in Py
# thon 3.3, or try to implement this on your own and use at least o
# ne list comprehension in the solution.

# Extra:

# Randomly generate two lists to test this

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

c = set(a + b)

print(c)
